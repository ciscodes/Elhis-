      <h1>A Wonderful Autumn by Melina Maninga</h1>
      <p>Maningaâ€™s paintings are unique. She brings to life the colours of the world with wild and riotous movement but, the chaos on the canvas does not reflect the meticulous and inventive process that allowed him to capture bodies in motion.
        After the talk Mel will be able to answer your questions in a live Q&A.</p>
      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>Expansive in their vision, Melina Maninga paintings are seemingly simple yet highly skilled in application. Particularly of note are her beautiful paintings of contemporary art. Her colours are famous for the moods they depict.
        Born in 1980 in South Africa, Melina is self taught and started to paint full time in 1999. She is an artist whose career spans two decades and several continents with works in major collections all over the world. Melina's bold colour palette and material choices, along with her unique technique and talent create a rare combination of beautiful contemporary art built on traditional foundations. These works are more than a depiction of the artist's love affair with poetry. These are paintings of love - loaded with passion, emotion and positivity. Join us for 'A Wonderful Autumn'.
